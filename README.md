This project is about evaluating the performance of an intelligent agent and supporting different levels of automation (LOA).

At the moment, we present two scenarions to showcase the need for process adaptations to support different LOA.



#### Two cases are presented here 

1. Simulating an IA for identifying a team that should handle a service incident - [ITIL_IA]
